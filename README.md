# Welcome!

## I hope you are enjoying my budget app. I am currently in beta and working on version 1.0

 When testing out the app, please log feedback and bugs as a "git issue"

## Logging a Git Issue

In the tab bar above, click the second tab labeled "Issues". On the right hand side, there is a green button labeled "New". 
Write down a descriptive name and add as much detail as you can. Screenshots are highly encouraged!
